Improve the script. Few more thoughts:
1. Take Directory name as Input and recursively find the file types.
2. Copy or Move
3. What if metadata not found for the Picture. Seems many old pictures
   do not have metadata embedded.
4. Identify thumbnails folders and not process.
5. Identify Transcoding folders and not process.
6. Use Blake3 version
7. Log the list of files processed, skipped and any other stats.

* Runtime Options
1. Dry Run
2. Recursive
3. Silent, Quiet Progress
4. Copy or Move
5. Folders and File Names Convention, Format
6. Adjust date i.e consider pictures takes after midnight as taken on
   same day.change time of day when the day "begins".
7. De-duplication or save copy

* Photo Tagging features
1. Geo Tagging
2. Reverse geo location lookup, using OpenStreetMap
3. Face Recognition
4. Batch Tagging
5. Tagging Data stored in a Local Database
6. “Fast Find” Complex Search Capability
